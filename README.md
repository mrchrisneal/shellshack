# shellshack
Personal repository of random user scripts.
Comes with an updater of sorts.

**Important**: Some scripts come bundled with a `prefs_template` file. Make a copy of this file--call it `prefs` (without the `_template` part) and place it in the same directory, then edit the variables inside the file to your liking.
