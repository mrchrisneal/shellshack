# shellshack for unRAID
Personal repository of random user scripts for unRAID.
Comes with an updater of sorts.

## Important notes on updates
Some scripts come bundled with a `prefs_template` file. Make a copy of this file--call it `prefs` (without the `_template` part) and place it in the same directory, then edit the variables inside the file to your liking. The template will be updated alongside the other script files, but the `prefs` file will always stay the same.

## Installation
In an unRAID terminal, enter the following command:
`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrchrisneal/shellshack/main/install.sh | bash`
